### I did not receive the item I purchased
On some occasions, in order for a purchased item to load the game must be restarted. Before restarting, check for any updates to the game in your app store. 

If you still have not received the item after going over the first steps, please send us your receipts from the platform you used to buy them (iTunes, Google Play, Facebook, Amazon,). Sending us a message can be done through the game by tapping the menu button on the top right corner of the screen and clicking on “Settings” near the bottom of this list. At the bottom of the Settings menu is a Support button that will automatically open an email addressed to us with the necessary user information needed to assist you. Please make sure to leave the Device ID and User ID in the subject line!
