### General troubleshooting for mobile devices
If your game is freezing, crashing, not loading, or behaving irregularly we recommend trying these steps:
1. Please close all apps and restart the device.
 2. Make sure you have the latest update of the game installed.
 3. Launch the game.
 If the issue persists:
 1. Please check for any updates for your device.
 2. Clear the cache on your device.
 If you do not know how to clear cache you can follow one of these guides:

 Google Chrome
As a last resort, you can try reinstalling the game as it usually fixes most issues. Please note that your game progress can only be saved when you play while signed in to your Facebook account so make sure it is before reinstalling!
If your game is still not working properly after following the steps above please contact our Support team. This can be done by clicking the "Contact Us" button below.Â 

 Lastly, please try to answer the following questions in your email to us:


When did this issue first start happening - after an update?


Does it happen when the game is loading or within the game itself?


Does it happen during a raid, attack or other action?


Does it happen regularly?
