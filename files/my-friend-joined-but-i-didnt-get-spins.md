### My friend joined but I didn’t get spins  
Coin Master is a social game, and because of that, notifications are sent to alert the player that new friends are in the game and ready to play!
 
 In order to earn spins, the friend invited has to meet a number of requirements. The first and most important is that the friend invited has never had the game on their device before. Next, the friend needs to do the following in one sitting:
 - Click on the invitation 
 - Download the game
 - Launch the game
 - Sign into Facebook
