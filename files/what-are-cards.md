### What are cards?
Cards are collectible items that are found throughout the game. 9 unique Cards make up each themed Collection.  

Each completed Collection rewards players with spins and other great gifts as well - including Pets! The rarer the Collection of Cards, the bigger the reward!

When it comes to finding new Cards, the village you are in determines the cards you will receive from chests and their rarity as well. 

Please note that Gold Cards can be found in higher Villages than you will find the rest of the cards. 

You can also trade normal Cards with your friends at any time and Gold Cards during special Gold Card Trading events.
