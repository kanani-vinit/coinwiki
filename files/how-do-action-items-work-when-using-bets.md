### How do action items work when using bets?
When it comes to the action items on the slot machine, the Bet feature works a little bit differently than with coins or spins. 

When it comes to Attacks and Raids, Bets multiply the number of coins received from each action. 

Winning shields with Bets increases the number of shields rewarded by a single spin, and any shields that go over the maximum of three will be returned to the player in the form of spins.
