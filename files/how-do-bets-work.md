### How do bets work?
Bets multiply rewards earned from actions but do not apply to those from special events. Raids and Attacks are multiplied after the action is complete, and when it comes to the slots, the amounts displayed at the top are multiplied already. The Bet button cycles between all available bets from lowest to highest.
