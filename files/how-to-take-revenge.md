### How to take revenge
When you spin and land on an Attack, the game will transport you to a random Village of one of your friends or of a random player for you to Attack. 

At the top of the screen, you will see the “Revenge” button. Tapping this button will reveal a list of the last number of players who attacked you and will let you choose which one to exact your revenge on.
