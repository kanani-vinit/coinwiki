### Can I change my username or picture?
If your game is linked to your Facebook account it takes your name and picture from there and it cannot be changed from within the game. 

If you are playing as a guest using iTunes, Google Play, or Amazon account, the name and picture chosen for your Viking at the beginning of the game cannot be changed.
