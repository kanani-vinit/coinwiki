### How many shields can I have?
Each player can have a maximum of three (3) Shields in their collection. 

If a Shield is won on the slot machine while the player already has three, the spin used to win the shield will be returned. This can be seen at the end of the shield animation - a “+1” will appear near the spin counter. If Bets are used, the player will receive the same amount of Spins back.
