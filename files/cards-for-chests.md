### Cards for Chests
Trade your duplicate cards for brand new chests!
Now it is possible to trade your duplicate cards for 3 new types of chests, each of which presents a different combination of rewards with varying amounts of Spins, Pet Food, Pet XP, and Cards!

Each card shows a number of stars at the top that show its value, and these numbers are added up when selecting which cards to trade for a new chest. This feature will automatically select the lowest level and least rare cards to trade, but this can be disabled by tapping on the "Select cards for me" checkbox to allow for manual selection of cards to trade. 
After a chest is traded for, a timer will appear which will lock the trade for another chest of the same type for a certain amount of time. However, this timer can be skipped a certain number of times with the use of coins. 
Don't worry, the card trade will not decrease your game stars!
