### How do I get cards?
Cards are most often collected through chests which can be won from events, found during Raids, or purchased with coins. When it comes to finding new Cards, the village you are in determines the cards you will receive from chests and their rarity as well. 

Another great way to collect cards is by trading with friends. Normal Cards can be traded at any time with a limit of 5 per day, and Gold Cards can be traded during special events. 

Lastly, the Viking Quest event also rewards you with a rare Gold card when completed.
