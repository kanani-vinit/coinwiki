### A friend is targeting me with attacks
Players who have many spins are able to play continuously and land many action items (Attacks / Raids) in short periods of time. Unlike with raids, players have the option to choose who they attack. 

 Aside from asking this friend to stop, they can also be removed from your game by unfriending them on Facebook. Please note that after unfriending someone it can take up to 24 hours until the friends’ list is updated, and during this time that friend will still be able to interact with you in the game.
