### Moon Active - GDPR
What is the GDPR?
The GDPR is a regulation intended to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the EU. It aims to protect the fundamental right to privacy and the protection of personal data.
Moon Active and GDPR
Moon Active is committed to data protection and has taken steps to align with the GDPR.
Some of the steps we’ve taken:


We created a GDPR task force to perform the required analysis.


The next step was an evaluation of our current security and data protection practices and GDPR readiness levels.


We performed a complete and detailed evaluation of our personal data processing activities.


We have created and regularly evaluate our internal processes and procedures to ensure we meet the GDPR requirements.


We’ve updated our Privacy Policy to be simpler and easier to understand and to better reflect our data practices.


What are your rights under the GDPR?
