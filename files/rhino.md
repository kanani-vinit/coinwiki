### Rhino
Rhinoâ€™s purpose in the game is to help protect your village! If your village is being attacked by another player and you have run out of shields, your Rhino will have a chance to block that attack. 
Please note that when first hatched, the Rhino has a 10% chance of blocking attacks. Using XP Potions to level him up will increase this chance.
In order to unlock the Rhino, you will first need to complete the Creatures Card Collection.
