### Spin gifts
You can gift your friends one spin each and they can do the same for you! Gifting a spin doesn’t use any of your own spins, and you can collect up to 60 each time as long as the spins bar is empty.

Tap on "Gifts"  to open up the Gift Menu where you will be able to send and collect gifts of Coins, Spins, and Cards. As noted at the bottom of the Gift Menu, Spins and Coins which are sent to friends are not taken from your balance. 

When it comes to Coins, the range that can be sent and received differs depending on the Village level.
