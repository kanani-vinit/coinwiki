### How do I remove a friend from my game?
Friends can be removed from the game when they are unfriended on Facebook. Once they are removed, they will be randomly replaced by another Facebook friend.

Please note that after unfriending someone, it can take up to 24 hours until the friends’ list is updated. During this time that friend will still be able to interact with you in the game.
