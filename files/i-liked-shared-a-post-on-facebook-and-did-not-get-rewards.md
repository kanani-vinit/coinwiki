### I liked/shared a post on Facebook and did not get rewards 
Unfortunately, there are several fake Facebook pages promising rewards for liking, commenting on, and sharing posts as well as clicking their links.
We would like to apologize for the confusion and reassure you that we are constantly working on getting these pages removed. 

Our official pages on Facebook are only the Coin Master Main Page and the Coin Master Trading Group. If you see posts such as these from any other page we recommend reporting them to Facebook immediately.
