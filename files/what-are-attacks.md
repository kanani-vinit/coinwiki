### What are attacks?
Attacks, which are represented by Hammers on the slots, are a way for players to earn coins while also adding challenge to their friends’ quests to finish their villages. 

When you land an Attack on the slot machine, the game will automatically transport you to a village of a random player or friend, and there you will have the option to either attack that player or choose someone else from your “Friends” or “Revenge” lists which are displayed at the top of the screen.
