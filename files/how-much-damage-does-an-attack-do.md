### How much damage does an attack do?
Without a shield, an Attack from another player reverts the item hit back one level. This also removes a Star from the total number the Attacked player collected.

If the player being attacked is protected by a Shield or the Rhino, the oncoming Attack will be deflected and will not damage the Village.Â
