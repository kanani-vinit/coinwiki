### Connection error
Connection errors can happen seemingly at random. Even with a strong internet connection, there may be other apps or services that are interfering with the game’s connection. We recommend shutting down the game completely (removing from recent apps) and launching again. If the problem persists, uninstalling and reinstalling the game can also fix this - don’t worry, as long as your game is linked to your Facebook account you will not lose your progress. Follow the General Troubleshooting Guide for more detailed instructions.
If your game is still not working correctly after following the steps in the troubleshooting guide, please contact our Support team by pressing on the "Contact Us" button below. 


Please do your best to answer these questions in your email to the support team.

When did this issue first start happening - after an update?
Does it happen when the game is loading or within the game itself?
Does it happen during a raid, attack or other action?
Does it happen regularly?

If possible, please attach a screenshot or a video.
