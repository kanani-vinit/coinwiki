### Friend invite limit
There is a limit on the number of rewards that a single player can receive from friends who have joined the game. Once a player has collected Spins from 250 friends who joined the game, they will no longer be able to receive such rewards. 

There are still many great ways to earn spins in the game, however. You can gift each of your friends 1 spin each day and they can do the same for you! Gifting a spin doesn’t use any of your spins, so with the right group of friends you can send and receive up to 50 free spins each time!
On top of that, there are many different raffles, contests, and giveaways hosted on our social media pages which you can participate in to win spins and other incredible rewards!
