### How to protect your village from attacks
There are two ways to protect a village from Attacks. 

The first is by using shields; when a player attacks your village the shield will protect your items automatically and break in the process. 

The second way to protect a village is by hatching the Rhino pet. When you do not have any shields, the Rhino will have a certain percentage chance of blocking the attack.
