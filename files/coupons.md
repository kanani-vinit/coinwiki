### Coupons
Coupons! A wonderful way to get an extra value from purchases of Spins or Coin packs! 
Coupons are a fun and valuable new attribute that will be present on special occasions! They are like personalized single-use sales, but remember they can be used only once!
Coupons can be found in the Gift's Inbox and must be applied there before making a purchase.
A countdown timer shows when the Coupon expires and can no longer be used.
 
####Coupons & The Multiplier Wheel
When a Coupon is used, it provides a percentage more on top of the original amount of items that you would have originally received.
Subsequently, the way that the purchase multiplier works is that it takes your original purchase and multiplies it by the number that the wheel lands on and the result is what you receive for both purchases. It does not multiply the amount received from the coupon.

For example:

Generally, if 100 Spins are purchased with a 300% coupon then a total of 400 Spins are received. However, if the multiplier wheel is also purchased and it lands on x2, it will multiply the original pack of 100 Spins which makes it 200 and the coupon amount will be separate. Therefore, alongside the 300 Spins from the Coupon, the total received in this case would be 500 Spins.
