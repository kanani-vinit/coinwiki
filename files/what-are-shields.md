### What are shields?
Shields are the action items used to protect Villages from attacks. They can be earned by spinning the slots. 

Each player can have a maximum of three shields in their collection at once and any extras that are won while spinning are returned as spins. 

Once a player has Shields, they will be used automatically whenever another player tries to attack their village. No intervention by the defending player is necessary.
