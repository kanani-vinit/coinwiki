### I was charged more than the purchase price
If you are using a platform other than iTunes please send us your receipts from the platform you used to buy them (Google Play, Facebook, Amazon,). Sending us a message can be done through the game by tapping the menu button on the top right corner of the screen and clicking on “Settings” near the bottom of this list. At the bottom of the Settings menu is a Support button that will automatically open an email addressed to us with the necessary user information needed to assist you. Please make sure to leave the Device ID and User ID in the subject line!

#### iTunes (iOS players)
iTunes occasionally aggregates several purchases into one charge so it's possible this charge is for earlier purchases as well. We do not have access to your billing information and cannot make any charges to your account. If you feel a mistake has been made, please contact iTunes support HERE.
